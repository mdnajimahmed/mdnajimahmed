I'm a technical problem-solver, experienced in backend engineering using Java, AWS, SQL and NoSQL databases e.g. PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB etc. I thrive in the realm of coding excellence, however, my added year-long expertise in DevOps and Cloud Technology elevates my capability to design and operate systems at a large scale. I deeply care about clean code, design patterns and maturity of tests while developing a solution, and for operations, I follow the 12-factor methodology, leverage cloud services, and maintain a robust DevSecOps pipeline with comprehensive testing and security measures having a "shifting left" automation mindset.

I am also an effective team player, I have led more than 20 engineers across 4 different teams and successfully delivered 10+ projects. My biggest achievement as a team lead is to deliver a product on Java, Postgres, Redis and AWS stack that is used by 40,000 employees of a Fortune 500 company with zero downtime and <150ms p95 response time across 40+ APIs and I have successfully secured highly sensitive personal information of the employees in a way that passed Google Madiant Pen Test, AWS Security Audit and the Company's internal CS Audit.

My primary programming stack is Java and Spring Boot, however, I have also developed solutions on the serverless stack using NodeJS and GoLang. Besides software development, I love to challenge myself to solve algorithmic problems that often require advanced data structures to process a large dataset under strict time constraints. Starting from 2009, I have solved 2000+ problems in 10+ platforms e.g. Topcoder, Codeforces, LeetCode, UVA, URAL, USACO etc and participated in 300+ online competitions and 50+ onsite competitions.

I also love continuously educating myself by taking online courses from Udemy and doing Certifications. I am currently 4x AWS certified and Kubernetes Certified Application Developer.

Occasionally, I do small fun projects to explore new domains e.g IOT/Machine Learning/Big Data. Here are two of my noteworthy projects - 

# Detect toilet occupancy in real-time

# Control an esp8266 IOT Device with voice command
